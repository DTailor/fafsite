        - add in here a JS array/dict of all available meta types
        - using JS find those that are allready used
        - provide a plus button that after clicking will:
            - provide ability to choose type of new meta data (only from those existent and that where not added allready)
            - by choosing meta type, user will have either text input or select list (depending on meta type)
        - near metatypes there will be x(delete) buttons to be able to erase unnecessary meta fields
        - there is no need in AJAX
