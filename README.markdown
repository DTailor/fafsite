FAF Site
==============

What is FAF?
--------------
FAF represents an English Taught Honor's Program in Computer Science at the Technical University of Moldova. Basically we are a group of enthusiastic and proactive students that try their best. 

In order to share things and promote ourselves we decided to lanch our website.
